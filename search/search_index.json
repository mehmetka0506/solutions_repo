When damping and external periodic forces act on a pendulum, its behavior ranges from predictable oscillations to complex and chaotic motion. This diversity reflects many real-world systems \u2014 from electronics to biomechanics. By tuning parameters like the damping factor and the strength and frequency of the driving force, we observe phenomena such as resonance, quasiperiodicity, and transitions to chaos. These insights are fundamental in understanding oscillatory systems in engineering, physics, and nature. 1. Mathematical Framework Differential Equation The system is modeled by the second-order nonlinear ODE: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\sin\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] Where: - \\(\\theta\\) : angular displacement - \\(b\\) : damping coefficient - \\(g\\) : gravitational acceleration - \\(L\\) : length of pendulum - \\(A\\) : external driving amplitude - \\(\\omega\\) : angular frequency of the driving force Linear Approximation (Small Angle) For small angular displacements: \\[ \\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta \\] Reducing the equation to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t) \\] This linear form simplifies simulation and helps analyze regular behavior before chaos emerges. 2. Parameter-Based Behavior Analysis We analyze system behavior by varying: Damping coefficient \\(b\\) Driving amplitude \\(A\\) Driving frequency \\(\\omega\\) This helps reveal: - Transition from underdamped to overdamped behavior - Resonance and amplification - Onset of chaotic regimes 3. Real-World Relevance This model describes: - Suspension systems in vehicles - Oscillating electrical circuits (e.g., RLC) - Structures under periodic stress - Biological movement patterns (gait dynamics) 4. Python Modeling Below is a simulation using solve_ivp from scipy.integrate to model pendulum behavior for different conditions. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp def dynamics(t, y, b, g, L, A, omega): theta, omega_ = y return [omega_, -b * omega_ - (g / L) * np.sin(theta) + A * np.cos(omega * t)] # Setup y0 = [0.15, 0.0] t_range = (0, 60) t_eval = np.linspace(*t_range, 1500) cases = [ {\"label\": \"Light Damping\", \"b\": 0.1, \"A\": 0.8, \"omega\": 1.0, \"color\": \"royalblue\"}, {\"label\": \"Critical Damping\", \"b\": 0.6, \"A\": 0.8, \"omega\": 1.0, \"color\": \"firebrick\"}, {\"label\": \"High Drive\", \"b\": 0.3, \"A\": 1.8, \"omega\": 3.0, \"color\": \"darkgreen\"}, ] g = 9.8 L = 1.0 fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(cases), 2, figsize=(12, 11)) for i, c in enumerate(cases): sol = solve_ivp( dynamics, t_range, y0, args=(c[\"b\"], g, L, c[\"A\"], c[\"omega\"]), t_eval=t_eval ) theta, omega_ = sol.y axes[i, 0].plot(sol.t, theta, color=c[\"color\"]) axes[i, 0].set_title(f'{c[\"label\"]} - \u03b8(t)') axes[i, 0].set_xlabel(\"Time (s)\") axes[i, 0].set_ylabel(\"\u03b8 (rad)\") axes[i, 0].grid() axes[i, 1].plot(theta, omega_, color=c[\"color\"]) axes[i, 1].set_title(f'{c[\"label\"]} - Phase Diagram') axes[i, 1].set_xlabel(\"\u03b8 (rad)\") axes[i, 1].set_ylabel(\"\u03c9 (rad/s)\") axes[i, 1].grid() plt.tight_layout() plt.show() 5. Simulation Outcomes Light Damping - Oscillations persist - Phase plot shows large elliptical orbits Critical Damping - Motion stabilizes quickly - System returns to equilibrium smoothly High Drive - Complex motion develops - Phase space suggests early chaos 6. Summary and Future Work This experiment demonstrates how driven damped pendulums can show both stability and complexity, depending on parameters.
